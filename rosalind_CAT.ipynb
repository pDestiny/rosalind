    "A matching in a graph is a **noncrossing** if none of its edges cross each other. If we assume that the $n$ nodes of this graph are arranged around a circle, and if we label these nodes with positive integers between 1 and n, then a matching is noncrossing as long as there are not edges {i, j} and {k, l} such that i < k < j < l\n",
    "\n",
    "A noncrossing matching of basepair edges in the bounding graph corresponding to an RNA string will correspond to a possible secondary structure of the underlying RNA strand that lacks pseudoknots.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we will consider counting noncrossing perfect matchings of basepair edges. As a motivating example of how to count noncrossing perfect matchings, let $c_n$ denote the number of noncrossing perfect matchings in the complete graph $K_{2n}$. After setting $c_0 = 1$, we can see that $c_1$ should equal 1 as well. As for the case of a general n, say that the nodes of $K_{2n}$ are labeled with the positive integers from 1 to 2n. We can join node 1 to any of remaining 2n - 1 nodes; yet once we have chosen this node(say m), we cannot add another edge to the matching that crosses the edge {1, m}. As a result, we must match all the edges on one side of {1, m} to each other. This requirement forces m to be even, so that we can write m = 2k for some positive integer k.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2k-2 nodes on one side of {1, m} and 2n - 2k nodes on the other side of {1, m}, so that in turn there will be $c_{k-1} \\cdot c_{n-k}$ different ways of forming a perfect matching on the remaining nodes of $K_{2n}$. If we let m vary over all possible n-1 choices of even numbers between 1 and 2n, then we obtain the recurrence relation $c_n = \\sum^n_{k=1}c_{k-1} \\cdot c_{n-k}$. The resulting numbers $c_n$ counting noncrossing perfect matchings in $K_{2n}$ are called the Catalan numbers, and they appear in a huge number of other settings.\n",
